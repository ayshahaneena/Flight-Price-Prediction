# Flight-Price-Prediction
## Overview 

This is Flight Price Prediction Analysis. This project aims to predict flight prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical flight data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementing feature engineering, we strive to build an accurate predictive model.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical flight information, including departure and arrival details, airline information, and corresponding prices. The dataset is sourced from provide_source_here and is available in CSV format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different variables. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we explore factors influencing flight prices, identify trends, and detect outliers.

## Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering involves preprocessing the dataset and creating new features to improve model performance. Techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and extracting meaningful features are applied to enhance the predictive power of the model

## Tools and Libraries 
* Python
* Pandas 
* Numpy
* Sklearn
